**Detailed Project Information for "Weather App"**

### How the Project Works:

1. **Application Startup**:
   - Upon application startup, the `main()` function is called, initializing and running the main application widget `MyApp`.
   - `MyApp` creates an instance of `MaterialApp`, representing the root widget of the application, setting basic parameters such as theme and title.
   - `MaterialApp` in turn loads the main screen `WeatherScreen`.

2. **Viewing Weather**:
   - The `WeatherScreen` main screen displays the current weather for a given location.
   - Users can input a new location in the input field and confirm it to fetch the weather for that place.

3. **Refreshing Weather**:
   - When refreshing the weather, the `_fetchWeather` function is called, which updates the `_location` state and should update the weather data for the new location.

### Widgets Used:

- `MaterialApp`: To create a standard application layout using Material Design.
- `Scaffold`: To create a basic page layout, including an app bar and main content.
- `AppBar`: To display the application title and other information at the top of the screen.
- `Column`: To vertically arrange child widgets, such as weather icon, temperature, and weather conditions.
- `TextField`: For user input of a custom location.
- `Icon`: To display the weather icon.
- `AnimatedBuilder` and `Transform.rotate`: To create a rotation animation for the weather icon.
- `GestureDetector`: To handle taps on the refresh weather button.

### Adaptation for Screen Resolutions:

- **Text and Icon Sizes**: Text and icon sizes are calculated based on the screen width using `MediaQuery`, ensuring more proportional display across various devices.
- **Element Placement**: Flexible spacing and alignment are used to adapt the placement of elements depending on the available space on the screen.
- **Animation**: Animation duration and other parameters can be adjusted based on the screen resolution or user preferences.
